# Assessment - Part 1 (Backend using Laravel)


## Task

This assessment focuses on creating a **sign-up and sign-in system**, allowing users to upload their CV during the registration process. Additionally, a user's profile will be automatically generated by parsing the CV. Furthermore, the application will retrieve weather information based on the user's location.

The project involves the following components:

- **Frontend**: Developed using React.js
- **Backend**: Built with Laravel
- **Location Retrieval**: Utilizing IPSTACK API
- **Weather Data**: Obtained from OpenWeatherMap API

## Features

1. **User Registration**: Users can sign up by providing necessary information, including uploading their CV.
2. **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and login system to protect user data.
3. **CV Parsing**: The application will automatically parse the uploaded CV to generate a user profile.
4. **Location Retrieval**: User location will be determined using IPSTACK API based on their IP address.
5. **Weather Information**: The application will fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API corresponding to the user's location.
